Realtime forum application for my team and I to discuss and track issues being addressed in the project we may be working on

You will need the following in your app.config.js:
<pre>
app.config = {
    viewPath : "/app/views",
    firebaseAppUrl : "http://djenchat.firebase.com",
    firebaseAppSecret: "4wpZ63CXRSkIw5XD0Ohw2n6yrSnsaZv0mUJ2kwv4"
};
</pre>
